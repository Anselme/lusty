'''LustyExplorer''' is a fast and responsive way to manage files and buffers.  It includes both a filesystem explorer and a buffer switcher through a common interface.

It's like <code>find-file</code> crossed with <code>iswitchb</code> or InteractivelyDoThings, but with a larger and more easily readable dedicated window for completions instead of the minibuffer.

[http://viewglob.sourceforge.net/lusty-explorer.el.animated.gif Here's a 3.4 MB animated gif showing it in action]

After copying the file into your load-path, put this in your .emacs:

    (require 'lusty-explorer)

Launch the explorer with one of these commands:

    M-x lusty-file-explorer
    M-x lusty-buffer-explorer

'''LustyExplorer''' is based on the [http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1890 Vim plugin] of the same name.
