" Release Date: March 28, 2010
"      Version: 2.3.0
"
"        Usage: To launch the explorers:
"
"                 <Leader>lf  - Opens the filesystem explorer.
"                 <Leader>lr  - Opens the filesystem explorer from the parent
"                               directory of the current file.
"                 <Leader>lb  - Opens the buffer explorer.
"
"               You can also use the commands:
"
"                 ":LustyFilesystemExplorer"
"                 ":LustyFilesystemExplorerFromHere"
"                 ":LustyBufferExplorer"
"
"               (Personally, I map these to ,f and ,r and ,b)
"
"               The interface is intuitive.  When one of the explorers is
"               launched, a new window appears at bottom presenting a list of
"               files/dirs or buffers, and in the status bar is a prompt:
"
"                 >>
"
"               As you type, the list updates for possible matches using a
"               fuzzy matching algorithm.  Special keys include:
"
"                 <Enter>  open the selected match
"                 <Tab>    open the selected match
"                 <Esc>    cancel
"                 <C-c>    cancel
"                 <C-g>    cancel
"
"                 <C-t>    open selected match in a new [t]ab
"                 <C-o>    open selected match in a new h[o]rizontal split
"                 <C-v>    open selected match in a new [v]ertical split
"
"                 <C-n>    select the [n]ext match
"                 <C-p>    select the [p]revious match
"
"                 <C-w>    ascend one directory at prompt
"                 <C-u>    clear the prompt
"
"               Additional shortcuts for the filesystem explorer:
"
"                 <C-r>    [r]efresh directory contents
"                 <C-a>    open [a]ll files in the current list
"                 <C-e>    create a new buffer with the given name and path
"
" Buffer Explorer:
"  - The currently active buffer is highlighted.
"  - Buffers are listed without path unless needed to differentiate buffers of
"    the same name.
"
" Filesystem Explorer:
"  - Directory contents are memoized.
"  - You can recurse into and out of directories by typing the directory name
"    and a slash, e.g. "stuff/" or "../".
"  - Variable expansion, e.g. "$D" -> "/long/dir/path/".
"  - Tilde (~) expansion, e.g. "~/" -> "/home/steve/".
"  - Dotfiles are hidden by default, but are shown if the current search term
"    begins with a '.'.  To show these file at all times, set this option:
"
"       let g:LustyExplorerAlwaysShowDotFiles = 1
"
"  You can prevent certain files from appearing in the directory listings with
"  the following variable:
"
"    set wildignore=*.o,*.fasl,CVS
"
"  The above example will mask all object files, compiled lisp files, and
"  files/directories named CVS from appearing in the filesystem explorer.
"  Note that they can still be opened by being named explicitly.
"
"  See :help 'wildignore' for more information.
"
"
" Install Details:
"
" Copy this file into your $HOME/.vim/plugin directory so that it will be
" sourced on startup automatically.
"
" Note! This plugin requires Vim be compiled with Ruby interpretation.  If you
" don't know if your build of Vim has this functionality, you can check by
" running "vim --version" from the command line and looking for "+ruby".
" Alternatively, just try sourcing this script.
"
" If your version of Vim does not have "+ruby" but you would still like to
" use this plugin, you can fix it.  See the "Check for Ruby functionality"
" comment below for instructions.
"
" If you are using the same Vim configuration and plugins for multiple
" machines, some of which have Ruby and some of which don't, you may want to
" turn off the "Sorry, LustyExplorer requires ruby" warning.  You can do so
" like this (in .vimrc):
"
"   let g:LustyExplorerSuppressRubyWarning = 1
"
" GetLatestVimScripts: 1890 1 :AutoInstall: lusty-explorer.vim
"
" TODO:
" - when an edited file is in nowrap mode and the explorer is called while the
"   current window is scrolled to the right, name truncation occurs.
" - enable VimSwaps stuff
"   - set callback when pipe is ready for read and force refresh()
" - uppercase character should make flex matching case-sensitive
" - FilesystemExplorerRecursive
" - restore MRU buffer ordering for initial BufferExplorer display?
" - C-jhkl navigation to highlight a file?
" - abbrev "a" will score e.g. "m-a" higher than e.g. "ad"

" Exit quickly when already loaded.
